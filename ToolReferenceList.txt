= technical explanation, + simple explanation

dotenv -------------------------------------------------
= loads environment variables from a '.env' file into
  'process.env'
+ helps protect sensitive info like your passwords, etc

express ------------------------------------------------
= web framework for node.js that provides a robust set
  of features for web and mobile applications
+ lets you use routing (get, post, etc), middleware,
  template engines like handlebars, easier ways to
  handle errors, serve static files and works with a
  bunch of different node modules and libraries

path (express) -----------------------------------------
= module in express that provides utilities for working
  with file and directory paths
+ lets you make routes to serve static files (.css, etc),
  and do other file-related things like normalizing
  routes across different environments

express-handlebars -------------------------------------
= a view engine for express that allows you to render
  dynamic HTML pages on the server side
+ this is just better HTML than original HTML because
  you can keep code that appears on every page and only
  change the exact things that need to be changed
  between URLS

handlebars ---------------------------------------------
= a view engine for express that allows you to render
  dynamic HTML pages on the server side
+ the difference is that normal handlebars is general
  purpose but express-handlebars is for web apps that
  are specifically built using express

handlebars VS express-handlebars -----------------------
WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE ONE OVER THE OTHER OR USE BOTH?
    From what I understand, you'd use handlebars when
    most of the content is static and won't change,
    then you'd use express-handlebars for the dynamic
    content on the page like user specific stuff
    (user name appearing on page, user comments etc.)

pg -----------------------------------------------------
= PostgreSQL client for node.js that allows applications
  to connect to and interact with PostgreSQL databases
+ connects you to PostgreSQL databases and lets you
  make queries, make transactions (multiple queries at
  once), and makes it easier to work with async/await

sequelize ----------------------------------------------
= promise-based node.js ORM library for PostgreSQL (among
  other things) that simplifies database interactions
  by abstracting SQL queries into JavaScript methods,
  providing a more intuitive way to manage database
  relationships and perform CRUD operations
+ lets you make models that represent tables in your
  database as JavaScript classes, makes it easier to
  work with SQL statements pretty much

eslint -------------------------------------------------
= a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic
  patterns found in JavaScript code.
+ lets you define and enforce best coding styles and best
  practices across your project, promotes consistency

nodemon ------------------------------------------------
= utility tool for node.js applications that helps
  developers automatically restart teh node.js application
  when file changes in the directory are detected
+ restarts your server after you save so that you don't
  have to do it over and over again
